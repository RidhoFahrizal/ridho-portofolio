            <p class="py-12 font lg:text-xl  md:text-sm sm:text-xs xs:text-2xs"> I’m an Informatics Engineering student with a strong drive to solve real problems
                through software. I enjoy turning complex challenges into clear, practical
                solutions—whetherthrough clean backend architecture, efficient data processing, or thoughtful product
                design.
                I’m constantly learning, building,
                and refining my skills to create software that actually makes a difference.
